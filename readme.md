# Manhunt

This script adds an additional Derby-style game mode called Manhunt, which can be joined via the /hunt command.

## Rules

In Manhunt, a random player is designated as the Hunted and must kill his pursuers, the Hunters.
For every Hunter the Hunted kills, he gains 1 point. The Hunter who kills the Hunted recieves 5 points and respawns as the new Hunted.
Every player spawns with a revolver. The Hunted recieves an assault rifle, while Hunters get sniper rifles.
The Hunted has a red name, while Hunters have green names.
The game mode takes place in a parallel World with its own chat, so it won't interfere with normal play. In addition, players in Manhunt who leave the game area are killed.
